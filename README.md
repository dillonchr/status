# Status
I realized today that a site I thought I had redeployed to a new server was 502ing. I don't know why
I tried to hit the site, just felt like seeing how it performed I guess. So then I thought, why
don't I have something to easily check for this kind of stuff. I just ridded myself of 5 or 6 other
domains with some subdomains on those. I never had a status checker that whole time.

Well fret no more. Starting small, then let's get cronny. Then let's get some UI and maybe
ultimately get it plugged into the printer for the daily roundups I've been dreaming of since I got
the thermal printer.
